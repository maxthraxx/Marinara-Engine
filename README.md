## Changelog

### v1.4.6

**New Features:**

- **Embedding Base URL** — Configurable base URL for embedding endpoints, allowing custom embedding servers per connection.
- **Browser Refresh on Error** — The Bot Browser tab now shows a "Refresh" button when search fails, instead of a static error message.

**Improvements:**

- **Performance — Streaming Re-render Optimization** — Extracted `StreamingIndicator` and `RegeneratingMessageContent` into self-contained components that subscribe to the stream buffer independently. The main `ChatArea` no longer re-renders on every token (~30–60×/sec), drastically reducing CPU usage during streaming.
- **Performance — Zustand Selector Batching** — Combined 5 individual `useUIStore` selectors in `ChatMessage` into a single shallow-compared selector via `useShallow`, and memoized style objects (`textStrokeStyle`, `narrationTextStyle`, `chatTextStyle`, bubble colors) to avoid recreating them on every render.
- **Performance — Debounced UI Persistence** — UI store `localStorage` writes are now debounced (1 s) via a custom `createJSONStorage` adapter, preventing synchronous I/O on every state change (e.g. dragging sliders).
- **Performance — Action Selector Cleanup** — Converted 4 action-only selectors (`setActiveChat`, `setShouldOpenSettings`, `setShouldOpenWizard`, and callback-only `setActiveChatId`) to `getState()` calls, eliminating unnecessary re-render subscriptions.
- **Chat Text Appearance** — Unified chat text color with a single "Chat Text Color" setting and a default text stroke width of 0.5 px.
- **Settings Panel Polish** — Renamed reset buttons to "Reset to default", removed redundant labels ("Color", "From"/"To"), and consolidated reset actions (text color reset also resets opacity to 90 %).
- **Roleplay Input Responsiveness** — Responsive padding/gap on the roleplay input bar, `min-w-0` on the textarea to prevent flex overflow on narrow screens, and `shrink-0` on the send button.
- **Home Page Mobile Layout** — Reduced padding on mobile (`p-4 sm:p-8`), constrained content width (`max-w-md`), and made QuickStart cards flex-wrap with responsive sizing (`w-24 sm:w-28`).
- **Folder UX** — New folders are created at the top of the list (server-side `sortOrder: 0` with existing folders shifted), folders render above unfiled chats, and the folder row now uses inline rename-on-click + a trash icon on hover instead of a three-dot menu.

**Bug Fixes:**

- **Fixed infinite re-render loop** — The combined Zustand object selector in `ChatMessage` returned a new reference every render, bypassing `memo()` and causing "Maximum update depth exceeded". Fixed by wrapping with `useShallow()`.
- **Fixed message background opacity** — Roleplay message bubbles used `rgba(0,0,0,…)` instead of the correct `rgba(23,23,23,…)` matching Tailwind's `bg-neutral-900/70` and `bg-neutral-900/60`.
- **Fixed new folders appearing at the bottom** — Two-part fix: server assigns `sortOrder: 0` to new folders (shifting existing ones down), and the client renders folders before unfiled chats.
- **Fixed missing DB column migrations** — Added `openrouter_provider`, `comfyui_workflow`, and `embedding_base_url` to `COLUMN_MIGRATIONS` so they auto-create on startup.
- **Fixed combat encounter `parseJSON`** — Corrected escape-sequence detection and added 3-level sanitization for AI responses in the combat agent.

### v1.4.5

**New Features:**

- **Buttplug.io Haptic Integration** — "Love Toys Control" agent with per-device capability detection and 6 haptic actions (vibrate, oscillate, rotate, position, stop, constrict). Characters can trigger device commands inline via `<haptic>` tags.
- **CYOA Choices Agent** — Generates 2–4 in-character choices after each roleplay response. Click a choice to send it as your next message.
- **Multi-Select Message Deletion** — Select and bulk-delete messages in both Conversation and Roleplay modes via a new dialog flow.
- **Echo Chamber Persistence** — Echo messages are now saved to the database and restored when switching back to a chat.
- **Profile Export/Import** — Full backup and restore of characters, personas, lorebooks, presets, and agent configs as a single JSON file.
- **Always-Enabled Send Button** — Roleplay mode now always shows a send/generate button with smart continue logic.

**Improvements:**

- **Responsive Layout** — Auto-closing panels on narrow screens, improved breakpoints, `min-w-0` overflow fix on AppShell.
- **Accessibility** — Message multi-select checkboxes now use proper `<button role="checkbox">` with `aria-checked` and `aria-label`.
- **Security** — Bulk message deletes are now scoped to the chat's `chatId`, preventing cross-chat deletion.
- **Validation** — `Number.isFinite()` guards on haptic intensity/duration in both the service layer and command parser.
- **Robustness** — Bulk deletes are chunked (500/batch) to avoid hitting SQLite's variable limit.
- **Echo Chamber** — `loadedChatRef` reset on toggle-off for proper reload on re-enable.
- **Haptic Safety** — Invalid device indices now return an empty target list instead of falling back to all connected devices.

**Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed the Echo Chamber agent count badge not updating.
- Fixed combat agent type mismatch error.
- Fixed Character Menu `.marinara` file import failing silently.
- "Clear Trackers" now also clears committed agent runs and agent memory from the database.
- Removed unused connections data from profile export envelope.

## Installation

## Windows EASIEST METHOD

Download **[Marinara-Engine-Installer-1.4.6.exe](https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/Marinara-Engine/releases/download/v1.4.6/Marinara-Engine-Installer-1.4.6.exe)** from the [Releases](https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/Marinara-Engine/releases) page and run it. The installer checks for Node.js and Git, clones the repo, installs dependencies, builds the app, and creates a desktop shortcut.

---

## Alternatives

### Run from Source (All Platforms)

### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** and **Git** installed before running Marinara Engine. pnpm is handled automatically by the start script.

**Install Node.js v20+:**

| Platform              | How to Install                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows               | Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and run it             |
| macOS                 | `brew install node` or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)               |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x \| sudo bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs` |
| Linux (Fedora)        | `sudo dnf install -y nodejs`                                                                    |
| Linux (Arch)          | `sudo pacman -S nodejs npm`                                                                     |

**Install Git:**

| Platform              | How to Install                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows               | Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer |
| macOS                 | `brew install git` or install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`    |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `sudo apt install -y git`                                                           |
| Linux (Fedora)        | `sudo dnf install -y git`                                                           |
| Linux (Arch)          | `sudo pacman -S git`                                                                |

Verify both are installed:

```bash
node -v   # should show v20 or higher
git -v    # should show git version 2.x+
```

### Quick Start

**Windows:**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git
cd marinara-engine
start.bat
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git
cd marinara-engine
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**Android (Termux):**

Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) from F-Droid (the Play Store version is outdated), then run:

```bash
pkg update && pkg install -y git nodejs-lts && npm install -g pnpm && git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git && cd marinara-engine && chmod +x start-termux.sh && ./start-termux.sh
```

The Termux launcher handles everything automatically — it downloads a prebuilt native module, installs dependencies, builds the app, and starts the server at `http://localhost:7860`. First run takes a few minutes on mobile. After that, just run `./start-termux.sh` to start.

> **Tip:** Install the PWA — tap the browser menu and "Add to Home Screen" for a native app feel.

The start script will:

1. **Auto-update** from Git (if a `.git` folder is detected)
2. Check that Node.js and pnpm are installed
3. Install all dependencies (first run only)
4. Build the application
5. Initialize the database
6. Start the server and open `http://localhost:7860` in your browser

### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git
cd marinara-engine
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm db:push
pnpm start
```

Then open **<http://localhost:7860>**. That's it — no account, no cloud, everything runs locally.

### Updating

**Updates are automatic.** Every time you launch Marinara Engine via `start.sh`, `start.bat`, or `start-termux.sh`, the launcher:

1. Pulls the latest code from GitHub (`git pull`)
2. Detects if anything changed
3. Reinstalls dependencies and rebuilds automatically
4. Runs database migrations

**You don't need to do anything** — just launch the app as usual, and you'll always be on the latest version.

This works for all platforms: Windows (installer or manual), macOS, Linux, and Termux.

To update manually (e.g., if you don't use the start scripts):

```bash
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm db:push
```

Then restart the server.

## Accessing from Mobile (or Another Device)

If you're running Marinara Engine on your computer and want to use it from your phone or tablet on the same network:

1. **Find your computer's local IP address:**
   - **Windows:** Open a terminal and run `ipconfig` — look for `IPv4 Address` (usually something like `192.168.x.x`)
   - **macOS:** Go to System Settings → Wi-Fi → click your network → look for `IP Address`, or run `ipconfig getifaddr en0`
   - **Linux:** Run `hostname -I` or `ip addr`

2. **Open a browser on your phone** (Chrome, Brave, Safari, etc.) and go to:

   ```
   http://<your-computer-ip>:7860
   ```

   For example: `http://192.168.1.42:7860`

3. **Install the PWA** — tap the browser menu and "Add to Home Screen" for a native app feel.

> **Tip:** If you're not on the same Wi-Fi, tools like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) give each device a stable IP address on a private network — install it on both devices, then use your computer's Tailscale IP instead.

---

## Development

```bash
# Start both server + client with hot reload
pnpm dev

# Server only (port 7860)
pnpm dev:server

# Client only (port 5173, proxies API to server)
pnpm dev:client
```

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: `EPERM: operation not permitted` when installing pnpm

If you see an error like `EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\yarnpkg'` or a corepack signature verification failure, this is a Windows permissions issue — corepack can't write to `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`.

**Fix (pick one):**

1. **Run as Administrator** — Right-click your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and select "Run as administrator", then run `start.bat` again.

2. **Install pnpm manually** (recommended — avoids corepack entirely):

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   Then run `start.bat` again.

3. **Update corepack** (if you want to keep using it):

   ```bash
   npm install -g corepack
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   ```

   Run these in an Administrator terminal.
