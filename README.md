### AI Agent System (18 Built-In)
Agents are autonomous AI assistants that run alongside your chat, each handling a specific task:

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **World State** | Tracks date/time, weather, location, and present characters |
| **Quest Tracker** | Manages quest objectives, completion, and rewards |
| **Character Tracker** | Monitors character moods, relationships, and inventory |
| **Persona Stats** | Tracks your protagonist's HP, MP, XP, and custom stats |
| **Narrative Director** | Introduces events, NPCs, and plot beats to keep the story moving |
| **Prose Guardian** | Rewrites AI responses to improve prose quality |
| **Continuity Checker** | Detects contradictions with established lore and facts |
| **Combat** | Turn-based RPG combat with initiative, HP tracking, and actions |
| **Expression Engine** | Detects emotions and selects character sprites |
| **Background** | Picks the best background image for the current scene |
| **Echo Chamber** | Simulates a live-stream chat reacting to your roleplay |
| **Prompt Reviewer** | Reviews and scores the assembled prompt before generation |
| **Illustrator** | Generates image prompts for key scenes |
| **Lorebook Keeper** | Automatically creates and updates lorebook entries |
| **Immersive HTML** | Formats roleplay output with styled HTML |
| **Consistency Editor** | Edits responses for internal consistency |
| **Spotify DJ** | Controls Spotify playback to match the scene mood |
| **Chat Summarizer** | Generates condensed summaries of long conversations |

All agents are disabled by default — enable only the ones you want. You can also create **custom agents** with your own prompts and tool configurations.

### Prompt Engineering
- **Preset System** — Save and load full prompt configurations (system prompt sections, sampling parameters, etc.)
- **Prompt Sections** — Modular prompt builder with drag-and-drop ordering, depth injection, and per-section toggles
- **Lorebooks** — World-building entries with keyword triggers that inject context automatically
- **Regex Scripts** — Custom text processing with regex find/replace on inputs and outputs
- **Macro System** — Template variables like `{{char}}`, `{{user}}`, `{{time}}`, and agent markers

### Connections & Providers
- **Multi-Provider** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, Mistral, Cohere, and any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Encrypted API Keys** — API keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256

## Installation

### Windows Installer

Download **[Marinara-Engine-Installer-1.3.0.exe](https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/Marinara-Engine/releases/download/v1.3.0/Marinara-Engine-Installer-1.3.0.exe)** from the [Releases](https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/Marinara-Engine/releases) page and run it. The installer checks for Node.js and Git, clones the repo, installs dependencies, builds the app, and creates a desktop shortcut.

You need **Node.js 20+** and **Git** installed first (the installer will tell you if they're missing).

---

### Run from Source (All Platforms)

### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** and **Git** installed before running Marinara Engine. pnpm is handled automatically by the start script.

**Install Node.js v20+:**

| Platform | How to Install |
|----------|---------------|
| Windows | Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and run it |
| macOS | `brew install node` or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x \| sudo bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs` |
| Linux (Fedora) | `sudo dnf install -y nodejs` |
| Linux (Arch) | `sudo pacman -S nodejs npm` |

**Install Git:**

| Platform | How to Install |
|----------|---------------|
| Windows | Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer |
| macOS | `brew install git` or install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install` |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | `sudo apt install -y git` |
| Linux (Fedora) | `sudo dnf install -y git` |
| Linux (Arch) | `sudo pacman -S git` |

Verify both are installed:
```bash
node -v   # should show v20 or higher
git -v    # should show git version 2.x+
```

### Quick Start

**Windows:**
```
git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git
cd marinara-engine
start.bat
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git
cd marinara-engine
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The start script will:
1. **Auto-update** from Git (if a `.git` folder is detected)
2. Check that Node.js and pnpm are installed
3. Install all dependencies (first run only)
4. Build the application
5. Initialize the database
6. Start the server and open `http://localhost:7860` in your browser

### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/marinara-engine.git
cd marinara-engine
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm db:push
pnpm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:7860**. That's it — no account, no cloud, everything runs locally.

### Updating

If you use the start scripts (`start.sh` / `start.bat`), **updates are automatic** — the launcher pulls the latest version from Git every time you start.

To update manually:
```bash
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm db:push
```

Then restart the server.

---

## Development

```bash
# Start both server + client with hot reload
pnpm dev

# Server only (port 7860)
pnpm dev:server

# Client only (port 5173, proxies API to server)
pnpm dev:client
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to customize:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `7860` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `file:./data/marinara-engine.db` | SQLite database path |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(empty)* | AES key for API key encryption (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging verbosity |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5173` | Allowed CORS origins |
| `SSL_CERT` | *(empty)* | Path to TLS certificate (e.g. `fullchain.pem`). Set both `SSL_CERT` and `SSL_KEY` to enable HTTPS |
| `SSL_KEY` | *(empty)* | Path to TLS private key (e.g. `privkey.pem`) |

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: `EPERM: operation not permitted` when installing pnpm

If you see an error like `EPERM: operation not permitted, open 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\yarnpkg'` or a corepack signature verification failure, this is a Windows permissions issue — corepack can't write to `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`.

**Fix (pick one):**

1. **Run as Administrator** — Right-click your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and select "Run as administrator", then run `start.bat` again.

2. **Install pnpm manually** (recommended — avoids corepack entirely):
   ```
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
   Then run `start.bat` again.

3. **Update corepack** (if you want to keep using it):
   ```
   npm install -g corepack
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   ```
   Run these in an Administrator terminal.
